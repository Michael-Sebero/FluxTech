## Requirements
https://github.com/CleanroomMC/ModularUI/releases/download/v2.5.0-rc2/modularui-2.5.0-rc2.jar

### What is FluxTech?
FluxTech is a fork of GregTech CEu bundled with [Gregfluxology](https://github.com/MCTian-mi/Gregfluxology), texture improvements from [GregTech Refreshed](https://github.com/ULSTICK/GregTechRefreshed/tree/main) and original tweaks.

This mod is about **technology** and **progression**.
* From simple crude tools which will allow you to process resources more realistically...
* Through **Steam Age** where early machines will help you save some precious resources and open new possibilities...
* To many **Electric Ages** where increasingly complex machines and logistics will become indispensable parts of your industrial regime.

A typical GregTech facility features large arrays of both single- and multi-block machines processing numerous resources, creating even more complex materials which will be used in machines of higher tiers.

### Project Goal
To improve the aesthetics of GregTech and improve universality with other mods which use different power systems.
